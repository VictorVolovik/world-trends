# World Trends

This project was developed as a test task to demonstrate a no-build workflow, integration with an external API, and deployment of a static website. It adheres to a no-build philosophy, as outlined by DHH [in his article here](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-get-faster-than-no-build-7a44131c). This approach emphasizes speed and simplicity, eliminating the need for build steps, resulting in faster development and easier deployment.
